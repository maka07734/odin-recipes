The "Odin Recipes" project is a recipe website, as directed by the curriculum of The Odin Project aka TOP. The project requirement is a basic HTML recipe website which includes a home page and three separate recipes that can be linked to from the home page. My focus is on recipes designed for indoor electric grills (e.g., George Foreman grills and the like), as Im always looking to expand my grilling repertoire and I have a hunch other home chefs would be interested in a few easy to make - and delicious - recipes. 

If you're reading this, I hope you like these recipes ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

Notes:
-Creating an easily replicable recipe template (starting with the grilled salmon recipe) made a world of a difference. After working out a few formatting issues, I was able to breeze through the remaining two recipes.
-I exclusively used images licensed to the public domain (and included photo credits).
-I did my best to use semantic HTML to help assistive devices and users of assistive devices have a good user experience.
-I kept verbiage simple, as I personally do not like overly verbose recipes when I just want to learn to make something.
-I included "to top" and "Home" links on recipe pages, for good UX
-I included a footer detailing author (that's me!) and project info, using my username.
-I think I'll look back at my git commits one day and feel either pride or shame. It's 50/50, but I did intentionally improve my commit messages as the project progressed so we shall see. I know I can definitely do better from here on out!
