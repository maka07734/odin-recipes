            <h2>Directions</h2>
            <ol>
              <li>Heat your electric grill. (Note: most indoor electric grills have a standard heat setting; if your grill has a specific setting for paninis, please follow the manufacturer's directions.)</li>
              <li>Lightly brush or drizzle the olive oil on the outsides of your bread slices (this will give them a lovely crunch and flavor after grilling).</li>
              <li>Spread the pesto on the insides of both slices of bread.</li>
              <li>Place tomato slices on the bottom piece of bread.</li>
              <li>Place mozzarella slices on top of the tomato slices.</li>
              <li>Place basil on top of the mozzarella slices.</li>
              <li>If seasoning with salt and pepper, do so now or skip this step.</li>
              <li>Place the second slice of bread on top of the rest of the ingredients.</li>
              <li>When your grill has finished preheating, place your sandwich on the grill and close the lid. Cook for 3-5 minutes depending on the thickness of your sandwich (you'll want the cheese to be melted).</li>
            </ol>
