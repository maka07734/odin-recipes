          <h2>Delicious Grilled Salmon Fillets</h2>
            <p>Mmmm...salmon. If you like salmon, read on to learn how to grill salmon fillets using an indoor electric grill.</p>
            <p><em><strong>Enjoy!</strong> Note: this recipe makes 2 servings and takes approximately 15 minutes or less to make.</em></p>
          
          <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>1 pound of salmon fillets</li>
              <li>4 tablespoons fresh squeezed lemon juice</li>
              <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
              <li>1 teaspoon dried thyme (or 1 tablespoon fresh chopped thyme)</li>
              <li>1/2 teaspoon sea salt</li>
              <li>1/4 teaspoon black pepper (freshly ground if possible)</li>
              <li>2-4 lemon wedges (as garnish)</li>
            </ul>

          <h2>Directions</h2>
            <ol>
              <li>Mix lemon juice, 1 tablespoon of olive oil, thyme, salt, and pepper in a bowl large enough to hold the salmon fillets as well.</li>
              <li>Rinse salmon under cold water if needed; pat dry with a clean paper towel or kitchen towel regardless. (Gently patting salmon dry helps it to cook properly.)</li>
              <li>Gently add salmon to the mixture you made in step one and coat thoroughly. Let the salmon sit to marinate while you move on to Step 4.</li>
              <li>Heat your electric grill. (Note: most indoor electric grills have a standard heat setting; if your grill has a specific setting for grilling fish, please follow the manufacturer's directions.)</li>
              <li>When your grill has finished preheating, gently toss your salmon in the mixture one more time before placing the fillets skin-side-down on the grill and closing the lid. Cook for 3 minutes before doing a status check. If fillets need more time, cook for an additional 3-5 minutes depending on the thickness of your fillets. (Note: salmon is finished cooking when it flaked easily when poked with a fork and is consistently opaque. If you like your salmon less cooked in the middle, cook for less time.)</li>
              <li>Plate and garnish with lemon wedges, to be squeezed onto cooked fillets for extra flavor if desired.</li>
            </ol>
