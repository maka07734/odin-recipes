          <h2>Delicious Grilled Salmon Fillets</h2>
            <p>Salmon is one of my favorite foods. It is a tasty source of clean protein with the added benefit of healthy fats and that support cognitive function. Salmon can be made in an oven or on the stovetop, and it can also be made on a grill. Since the recipes in this series focus on indoor electric grills, the following recipe will include instructions for grilling salmon on this type of apparatus for maximum flavor.</p>
            <p>An indoor electric grill differs from an outdoor grill in that the temperature is much lower (and you don't have to fuss with charcoal or complex cleanup). While you will not get the awesome smoky flavor that an outdoor grill infuses into salmon, you will definitely get a moist fillet with a crispy skin and gorgeous grill marks. Since salmon cooks quickly and should not be overcooked (trust me - you don't want to ruin a beautiful piece of fish!) it's very important to follow this recipe closely.</p>
            <p><em><strong>Enjoy!</strong> Note: this recipe makes 2 servings and takes approximately 15 minutes or less to make.</em></p>
          
          <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>1 pound of salmon fillets</li>
              <li>4 tablespoons fresh squeezed lemon juice</li>
              <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
              <li>1 teaspoon dried thyme (or 1 tablespoon fresh chopped thyme)</li>
              <li>1/2 teaspoon sea salt</li>
              <li>1/4 teaspoon black pepper (freshly ground if possible)</li>
              <li>2-4 lemon wedges (as garnish)</li>
            </ul>

          <h2>Directions</h2>
            <ol>
              <li>Mix lemon juice, 1 tablespoon of olive oil, thyme, salt, and pepper in a bowl large enough to hold the salmon fillets as well.</li>
              <li>Rinse salmon under cold water if needed; pat dry with a clean paper towel or kitchen towel regardless. (Gently patting salmon dry helps it to cook properly.)</li>
              <li>Gently add salmon to the mixture you made in step one and coat thoroughly. Let the salmon sit to marinate.</li>
              <li>Heat your electric grill. (Note: most indoor electric grills have a standard heat setting; if your grill has a specific setting for grilling fish, please follow the manufacturer's directions.)</li>
              <li>When your grill has finished preheating, gently toss your salmon in the mixture one more time before placing the fillets on the grill. Cook skin-side-down for 3 minutes before turning the fillets over and cooking for another 3-5 minutes depending on the thickness of your fillets. (Note: salmon is finished cooking when it flaked easily when poked with a fork and is consistently opaque. If you like your salmon less cooked in the middle, cook for less time.)</li>
              <li>Plate and garnish with lemon wedges, to be squeezed onto cooked fillets for extra flavor if desired.</li>
            </ol>
