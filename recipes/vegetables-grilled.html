          <h2>Easy to Make, Easy to Eat (If You Like Vegetables)</h2>
            <p>Try this recipe when you want grilled vegetables as a quick side dish.</p>
            <p><em><strong>Enjoy!</strong> Note: this recipe makes 2 servings and takes approximately 15 minutes or less to make.</em></p>
          
          <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>3 cups of your preferred vegetables, roughly chopped (eggplant, zucchini, bell peppers, broccoli, etc.)</li>
              <li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
              <li>1/4 teaspoon sea salt (or regular salt)</li>
              <li>1/8 teaspoon black pepper (freshly ground if possible)</li>
            </ul>

          <h2>Directions</h2>
            <ol>
              <li>Wash your vegetables and pat them dry with a paper towel or clean kitchen towel (drying them helps them to cook better).</li>
              <li>Chop your vegetables into bite-sized pieces, and place the cut pieces in a medium-sized bowl.</li>
              <li>Heat your electric grill. (Note: most indoor electric grills have a standard heat setting; if your grill has a specific setting for grilling vegetables, please follow the manufacturer's directions.)</li>
              <li>Add the olive oil, salt, and pepper to the vegetables in the bowl; stir gently until all vegetables are evenly coated.</li>
              <li>When your grill has finished preheating, place your vegetables on the grill in an even layer and close the lid. Grill for 3-5 minutes, turning vegetables halfway if needed.</li>
            </ol>
